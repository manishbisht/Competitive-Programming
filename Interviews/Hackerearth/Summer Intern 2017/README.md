#Problem Statement
##File Explorer
You have to design and create a functional file explorer which runs on the browser. The file structure should reside completely on the browser-end e.g. One should be able to create, edit and delete files on this virtual file system.

Please follow these guidelines while building the app :

- Use HTML5's new offline storage features for building the app.
- Your Javascript library usage should be limited to jQuery.
- You are free to use CSS pre-processors for styling.
- You must support two file types- text and images.
- The app must be responsive and function properly on mobile devices.
- All the design and interactions should be according to the images in this zip file. You will also find resources in the "resources" folder in the zip file.

Note: The objective of this task is to evaluate your core front-end skills and hence, you must not use any Javascript libraries apart from jQuery. This should be a pure front-end application and you should not develop any backend service using frameworks like NodeJs. You have to use only plain CSS and not frameworks like bootstrap, etc. However, you are free to use CSS pre-processors like SASS, Stylus, LESS etc.
