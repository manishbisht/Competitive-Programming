# Problem #466 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

A tree is symmetric if its data and shape remain unchanged when it is reflected about the root node. The following tree is an example:

```
        4
      / | \
    3   5   3
  /           \
9              9
```

Given a k-ary tree, determine whether it is symmetric.
