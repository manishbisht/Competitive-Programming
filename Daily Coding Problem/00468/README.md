# Problem #468 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```

you should return:

```
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
```

Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?
