# Problem #417 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a linked list, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. Print out the remaining nodes.

For example, suppose you are given the input 3 -> 4 -> -7 -> 5 -> -6 -> 6. In this case, you should first remove 3 -> 4 -> -7, then -6 -> 6, leaving only 5.
