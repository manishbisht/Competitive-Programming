# Problem #444 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That is, given a string of length N and a pattern of length k, write a program that searches for the pattern in the string with less than O(N \* k) worst-case time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return False.
