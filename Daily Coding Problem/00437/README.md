# Problem #437 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string "figehaeci" and the set of characters {a, e, i}, you should return "aeci".

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set, return null.
