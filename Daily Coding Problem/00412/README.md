# Problem #412 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Epic.

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term 1, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:

```
1
11
21
1211
111221
```

As an example, the fourth term is 1211, since the third term consists of one 2 and one 1.

Given an integer N, print the Nth term of this sequence.
